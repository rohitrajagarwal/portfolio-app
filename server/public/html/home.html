                In 11+ years, I have amassed a wealth of knowledge in the Software development lifecycle and beyond. 
                I started working on SAP's middleware platform as a Java developer. 
                Shortly after, I started working for VMware and gradually made my way to Staff Technical Program Manager serving the R&D Engineering teams and supporting programs on various scale - from add-on solutions to portfolio. 
                <br/> <br/>
                I ended my journey at Broadcom as a Professional Services Program Manager to manage customer deployment (post sales).</p>

                I hail from India and my family includes my parents and my 3 siblings.

                I love driving and specifically inclined towards owning a blue car as its my niece's favorite color
                    and it served as a catalyst in bonding with my niece.

                My hobbies include playing amateur Pickleball and Badminton. 
                I love watching documentaries and shows based on true stories on Netflix. 
                I am an amazing cook when it comes to Indian cuisine!

                On the artistic side, I sketch and work behind the pottery wheel.
